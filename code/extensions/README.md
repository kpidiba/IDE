# EXTENSIONS

VS Code extensions **let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow**. VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code.

## 1. Default Extension

- **Auto Close Tag** : Automatically add HTML/XML close tag.

- **Auto Rename Tag** : Automatically rename paired HTML/XML tag.

- **Better Comments** : The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.

## 2. Laravel Extension

- **DotENV** : VS Code extension is used to highlight the syntax of your `.env` file, which could be quite handy for spotting some problems.

- **Laravel Snippets** : It adds snippets for the Facades like `Request::`, `Route::` etc. Besides, this package also gives Laravel snippets to use in VSCode when building our applications. Instead of typing out longer Laravel commands, you just use prefixes like: `Auth`, `Cache`, `Config`, `Route`, `Mail`, `View` etc.

- **Laravel Artisan** : extension makes running `artisan` commands a breeze when using Laravel. To use it, you just need to trigger the VSCode command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and then typing `Artisan` and the artisan commands will show up to be executed.

- **Laravel blade snippets**

- **Laravel Extra Intellisense** :  provides auto-completion for Laravel in VSCode. Besides, this extension runs your Laravel application automatically and periodically to get the information needed to provide autocomplete(Views and variables, Route Middlewares, Configs, Route names and route parameters, Laravel mix function,Translations and translation parameters, Validation rules, Env, View sections and stacks).

- **Laravel goto view** : allows you to go from your Controller or Route to your view. You can use  `Ctrl`  or `Alt` + click to jump to the first matched Blade View file. It works similarly to the Laravel goto Controller extension.

- **Laravel Goto Controller** : VScode extension allows you to press `Alt` + click on the name of the controller in your routes file, and it will navigate you from the route to the respective controller file.

- **Laravel Blade Formatter** : is an opinionated Blade file formatter for VSCode.

- **Laravel Blade Spacer** : It is annoying when you try to echo out something in your Blade views with `{{ }}` and your whole line goes back 4 spaces.
